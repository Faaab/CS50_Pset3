# CS50_Pset3
For Problem set 3 of CS50's Introduction to Computer Science, I implemented an application that takes a textfile representing a song that the user provides as input, and outputs a WAV-file with music based on that file.

Various parts of the code were provided by the CS50 staff. These are the parts I implemented:
1. Transcribing 'Happy Birthday' into code readable by this application.
2. Implement the is_rest, duration and frequency functions in helpers.c
