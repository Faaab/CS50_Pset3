# CS50_Pset3
For Problem set 3 of CS50's Introduction to Computer Science, I implemented an application that plays a song based on a textfile that the user provides.
Various parts of the code were provided by the CS50 staff. These are the parts I implemented:
1. Transcribing 'Happy Birthday' into code readable by this application.
2. Implement the is_rest, duration and frequency functions in helpers.c
